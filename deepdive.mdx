## How it works

Checkout connects liquidity sources to arbitrary on-chain actions at the point of purchase. Checkout consists of three essential parts:

1. Liquidity aggregator
2. Routing engine
3. Checkout SDK

## Liquidity Aggregator
Users hold funds in many forms. Checkout seeks to be a universal payment rail, removing the technological barrier between user funds and their desired on-chain action. Here’s how it works:

- **EVM Wallets:** Users can spend funds from any token on any EVM chain.

- **Solana Wallets:** Users can spend funds from a Solana wallet to execute an action on an EVM chain.

- **Deposit Addresses:** Users can send ERC-20 tokens to a static deposit address associated with an arbitrary on-chain action on any EVM chain.

- **Centralized Exchanges:** Users can pay for on-chain actions with their centralized exchange account. If the user desires, these accounts can remain linked to Checkout for convenient future payments. Checkout intelligently suggests users spend tokens with the lowest-cost route for their specified action.

- **Card:** Checkout can pull funds from both debit and credit cards. Checkout can intelligently on-ramp the best intermediary asset in any jurisdiction to ensure users have the cheapest route to executing any action, regardless of region.

- **Continuous Expansion:** We are constantly working to add more liquidity sources. Soon, we will roll out support for additional chains and ecosystems, including Mantle, Blast, Linea, Cosmos, and Starknet.






## Routing Engine
Our routing engine makes it easy to execute any on-chain smart contract interaction. Here’s how our routing engine stands out:

- **Arbitrary Batched Actions:** With one signature from an EOA, users can execute a batched set of smart contract actions on any destination chain.

- **Optimized Routes and Speed:** Our routing engine is optimized to maximize available routes and reduce time to finality.

- **Slippage SLAs:** Our routing engine guarantees minimum execution prices, and auctions orders that can beat those minimums. This model enables price guarantees for customers.

- **Modular Routing:** When integrated with dApps that custody liquidity, such as AMMs or yield protocols, Checkout can use the dApps liquidity for all transactions on their platform.

- **Transaction Certainty:** Our routing engine ensures complete transaction certainty. If a transaction fails at a certain point, our engine will retry it. For instance, if a transaction involves multiple bridges and fails at one bridge, the user won't receive the wrong token on the wrong chain. Instead, Checkout covers the gas fees and retries the transaction, ensuring users receive their intended assets without hassle.

## Checkout SDK
The Checkout SDK by Fun.xyz seamlessly integrates into our customers' applications. Here’s what makes our Checkout SDK stand out:

- **Seamless Integration:** The Checkout SDK is a RainbowKit fork. It requires only ~80 lines of code and is compatible with your existing hooks.

- **Optimized for Conversion:** The SDK is ruthlessly optimized to maximize conversion rates. Checkout automatically nudges customers towards higher-converting payment methods, transaction amounts, and assets.

- **Conditional Display:** The Checkout SDK is only value-additive. If the user has the necessary funds to complete their action without Checkout, the SDK remains hidden, and the order processes as usual. This structure ensures Checkout only appears when it can provide additional value.

- **Easy Installation:** Installing the Checkout SDK is straightforward, and our dedicated integration team supports you every step of the way. We ensure that the integration process is quick and hassle-free.

- **Smart Accounts:** Checkout can create a smart account for new users during purchase.

Checkout by Fun.xyz enhances the functionality of your application and significantly boosts your transaction volume.
